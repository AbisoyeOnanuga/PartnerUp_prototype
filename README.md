The partner up chatbot widget available for testing. 

We developed this assistant to help emerging sustainable brands find the right marketing partners to boost their social media presence. You will answer a few questions about your company, build a profile of your brand and generate an introduction letter for you to send to your chosen social media marketing agency.

At the moment, the widget is hosted on my github page. We're planning on making a better experience with more coding skills.
