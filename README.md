# PartnerUp
The partner up is a prototype chatbot that was explored for the databricks data+AI hackathon. 

We developed this assistant to help emerging sustainable brands find the right marketing partners to boost their social media presence. The chat assistant will require users to answer a few questions about their companies, which builds a profile of your brand and helps generate an introduction letter for users to send to thier chosen social media marketing agency.

The idea was approached from a design lens and an interactive prototype made with Voiceflow is available at <a href="https://creator.voiceflow.com/prototype/648b8f7d02065e568f807c9a">PartnerUP</a>
